# 🤖 Human vs. AI: Face Detection Showdown

Can you distinguish real human faces from AI-generated ones better than a Deep Learning model?

## 🎮 How to Play
1. A face image will appear.
2. Click **Real** or **AI** to make your guess.
3. See if you were right, and check if the AI Model got it right too!
4. Compete to see who gets a higher score.

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes
This game is powered by a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset of real and fake faces.
